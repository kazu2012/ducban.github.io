I feel great. Haha.

I have just finished some courses about marketing and got some certifications. I also digged into SVG animation and for now having a know-how about how this shit works. And, I travelled a lot with my family. Yeah! Like I got all the time in the world for whatever I wanted to do. Especially drawing.

![Yoda the Cat](/public/uploads/images/2016-08-23-this-03.jpg "Yoda the Cat")

The cat in the piece above is Yoda, I drew it as a part of my lady's birthday card, with watercolor brushs and Copic markers. Everybody recognised it was a picture of my cat Yoda. Yay!

If you knew me and read this blog, you should be acknowledged that I started to draw again about a year ago. Until now I could handle the pencil quite good, but I still in the progress of learning the best way to work with watercolor brushs and markers. First, I need to get familiar with color. Then, I need to get used to the brushs and the markers. To make this transition going smoothly, I decided to buy a pack of colored pencils (which I found myself more comfortable with) to get started with the color. The piece below I drew *Elle the Eveven* from the TV series [Stranger Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(TV_series)). Again, everybody recognised her. Again, Yay!

And of course, I drew my lovely family again and again, day after day.

This.

This is great. Everything is great, especially my drawing learning progress. But to be honest, I don't like This.

For sure, it's great when we have time to learn, to practice new technologies, to enjoy life with family and to do what we truly love to do. But when we work for an agency we should be too busy to do any of the above stuffs. We should cry out loud at 8pm that we are hungry, our wives are angry because we didn't pick our children, our friends are yelling in the phone because we are again 2 hours late from our weekly hangout. And worse than everything, our clients are waiting.

That, I like That.

Normally nobody likes That. I don't like That, too. But at this moment when I feel great with This, I suddenly need That.

I need to be useful. I need to stop feeling bored and lonely at work. I need to create things. I need to stop doing things which just benefit only for me.

That, I need That.

And This. This needs to stop.

TL; DR: Too much time will kill you.
