Hmm, yet another Lunar New Year Holiday went through our boring life. Nah, I just wanted to write some drama words. Our Tet Holiday was way so cool. We said goodbye to The Year of Goat on beach. Yeah, you read it right! __On the beach__, how about that?

My friends were like "_Mui Ne again?_". My colleagues were like "_Mui Ne again?_". Everyone was like "_Mui Ne again?_". We were like "__Yes, Mui Ne again.__"

We stayed at [The Whales Village Guesthouse](https://www.agoda.com/lang-ca-voi-the-whales-village-guesthouse/hotel/phan-thiet-vn.html), a beautiful guesthouse inside a fish village. The village is surrounding by coco trees. The coco trees remind me my hometown in _Duc Pho_, __Quang Ngai__ where I almost spent all of my childhood summer breaks. The beach is 10 feet from the guesthouse where we could see the sun falls into the sea. And, magically, the guesthouse happens to have a swimming pool where Poc and I could go swimming everyday. And then we dragged our hungry bellies along the beach to discover a new restaurant for dinner. She planned alove. Amazing!

Yeah 2015 was a weird year. She went to the US __twice__ for business. I learned to cook and I did it good. Poc loved my food and I was so proud. I quit my job at VNG and started a new chapter of my career as a digital producer at an agency. We moved from District 7 to Thao Dien. Yoda went to another dimension for a while before got his awesome asses back to our universe. We sold our house to clear our debts. We are now being the slaves of __three cats__ while acting like the gods of __one dog__. And [I started drawing](http://ducban.com/facts/2016/01/20/this-is-us/).

Well, there is one weird thing which wasn't listed out above: __I didn't cross over the border last year__. Damn, I miss the air where I could see the bright sunligh on the lazy clouds underneath the plane. I miss the rain on the streets of Singapore which sudden comes sudden goes just like a teenage girl when she's in love. I miss the huge bookstore in BKK where I could be a child who eager to explore all the corners of it. Anyway, thanks to all my friends who went abroad and brought Starbuck's mugs for me. Hoping I could soon go abroad and bring them some weird gifts from there.

Phew, this node is quite long. I think it's all good to stop hyping about ourselves including myself. You can close this page now. Thanks for reading. You're rock!
