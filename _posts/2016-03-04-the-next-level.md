__... of UX in Vietnam.__

At the current time my keyboard __shocks__ me eveytime I type. That means it's hurt to write this note. But it worths, so read on.

Well, two weeks ago, [an amazing contest about UX](http://amazingux.vn/) in Vietnam got caught while stealing an oversea company's website layout for its website. There was a small flame war between the developers who gave the evidence about the stealing crime, and the contest spokesman who tried to gross over their mistake. The war ended when the owner of the company behind the contest raised his voice to commit their guilt.

Some of my friends were invited to join the judges of the contest. They still stay with the contest while I think they will withdraw. People said _that if the contest oganizer stole a website layout, including the source code and its graphic interface, then they didn't give a shit about this website's UX_. __How could an amazing UX contest being operated by people who don't care about UX?__ Then they concluded this contest is no more no less a PR activity for the company behind the contest. In this case my friends aren't judges but brand ambassadores. Anyway, since all my friends decided to stay with the contest, I hope their ambitousness will inspire people and will successfully raise the awareness about UX.

From another view, __it's not a bad thing when an UX expert has their chance to be a brand ambassador__. By all mean UX is now considering an important factor which would decide the success of every projects. This also notices that product owners are now having the clue about the flow of product developing in which UX takes a significant part. __Standards are forming__. __Conventions are agreed__. Everyone is now sharpening their process that would get shits done faster, easier and better. UX experts are like superstars now. Guess what, they are now proudly standing in the same stage with those famous showbiz idols _(without having to show any part of their bodies)_. UX is stepping a higher level in Vietnam. I am glad to say that.

Last week, I also read a very thoughful article that points out [design contests... are dangerous](http://www.nospec.com/design-contests). This article gave me the motive to write this note. By starting the contest with a scandal like that, the company behind the contest might not gain what they aimed. But UX people in Vietnam will have a chance to __show-off their skills__, to __prove their talents__, to __gain real field experiences__ and, of course, to win BIG PRIZES. 

That's it. I am now sparking with electricity. Yay!!!
