description: It's not everyday you see someone dances in their office. That's why I was impressed a lot.

In March, I went to a government office to finish some paperwork. Normally at other offices, eg. banks, I will need to press a button on a machine to take a ticket before get in a queue. There was no this kind of machine at this office. They had a girl doing the ticket work manually. This girl had happy feet.

It's not everyday you see someone dances in their office. That's why I was impressed a lot. The girl was simply moving her feet left and right, but her face was shining. I could see that she was very happy doing her job. She inspired me.

There are many ways to express character. I categorise them into two categories: On-the-line and off-the-grid. On-the-line are everything which sharable, like writing, singing, vblogging, selfie-ing ect. Off-the-grid are everything which unsharable, eg. morning running or walking pets. I am a fan of unsharable things because when I found them, they were happening. They were real for me and I could feel the joy of doing them. Saying that doesn't mean that on-the-line things aren't real, please don't judge.

My lady are taking some of my off-the-grid moments and share them on-the-line and to be honest, I am fine with it. It's not only because she is a Lion but also because I do respect her effort to digitalise them. If she didn't do it, our family couldn't have our "on-this-day" stuffs to travel back in time.

This is awesome when you are able to do what you love. Like having duck noodle on the street in the morning with your lady. Or runing like hell before the Sun rises to beat your latest records. Or dancing left and right on your office floor while doing your job. Or writing a big note about your 29 birthday noting down things you learnt all the last year. No matter they are on-the-line or off-the-grid, the only thing which matters is **Are you doing something or not?**. Stop plan but don't act. Life is short. Stay hard.
