This end of March node will be a list. Awesome stuffs ahead, read on.

* Firstly, those [Flag Stories](http://flagstories.co/) are for all the fans of [Sheldon Cooper's Fun with Flags](http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Sheldon_Cooper_Presents:_Fun_with_Flags). If you are a fan of The Big Bang Theory then you need to know that Ferdio, [an Infographic Agency](http://www.ferdio.com/), made this too good to be truth gift just for you. So, feel thankful and enjoy it.
* Year 2016 ways better to designers. From their LABS, Invision unleashed [its beast](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft) to improve the speed of webdesign for people on [Sketch](http://www.sketchapp.com/). From their school, [readymag started their free course about design](http://school.readymag.com/), started with [Font Pairing](http://school.readymag.com/fonts/) and [Grid](http://school.readymag.com/grid/). From his desk, [Sebastien Gabriel] wrote his [Designer's guide to DPI](http://sebastien-gabriel.com/designers-guide-to-dpi/). Not like 10 years ago where we were one step forward two steps back in the dark, now them good stuffs are all here on the table, so please use them wisely and don't be too smart for your own good.
* May is coming with two special dates: [May the First](http://www.may1reboot.com/) is an international relaunch of websites and portfolios by designers, developers & makers around the world, and [May the Fourth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day) is for Star Wars fans.
* Instagram is shipping its [biggest update](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11241184/instagram-new-feed-sort-algorithm) so far which could be a huge mistake. I myself don't think of it too much. People will survive the change.
* Lastly, there is [a letter](https://medium.com/life-tips/dear-tim-cook-abc3fbffba1b#.m1jjkeu83) which could be used as the proof that Apple's iPad Pro and Pencil are paper and pencil to some artists. Meanwhile, [people is dying](http://lifeistooshortformeetings.com/), why so serious.

That's it.
