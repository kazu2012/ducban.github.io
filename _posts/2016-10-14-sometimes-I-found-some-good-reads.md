Sometimes I found some good reads. I made a list but I don't push it to the Web. People already did it, I thought. Everybody shares the same stuffs on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Slack etc. Why should I do the same?

Sometimes I found some good reads. I made a list and pushed into this blog without a thought. Here they are:

* This is for startup people: [Why Founders Fail: The Product CEO Paradox](http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/10/why-founders-fail-the-product-ceo-paradox/ "Why Founders Fail: The Product CEO Paradox").
* This is not for startup people: [Fuck You Startup World](https://medium.com/@shemag8/fuck-you-startup-world-ab6cc72fad0e#.u301ckwcl "Fuck You Startup World").
* This is not for everyone no matter they are startup people or not: [I Used to Be a Human Being](http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/09/andrew-sullivan-technology-almost-killed-me.html "I Used to Be a Human Being").

Sometimes I found some good reads. Sometimes I found a workout tutorial. Here it is:

Sometimes I found some good reads. But today, this note, I decided to stop right here. Way too cool, huh?
