It is not everyday you attack an island and see the setup above. The name of this island is "True Love", wow!

Today is special to __The Owner__. It marks a milestone that he was in the same cage with his lady a.k.a __The Lion of Sadec__ for seven and a half years. It means he went through all the good/bad things to get there. If you ask him what would he like to share then the answer must be: 

>"Happy moments were good but struggling experiences were great. And it was even better when we did it together. She was there with me on the beach of Jimbaran seeing the sunset counting the planes took up and landed down. She was there with me when we were complete broke. Having her beside me means I don't have to be afraid of anything. Yes, she is a Lion because a Deer wont last open seasons. I am so proud I always have a Lion back home protecting my little boy, my crazy puppy and my bitchy cats."
