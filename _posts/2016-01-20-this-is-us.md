I like to draw. The piece below is one of my sketchs. It only took me 5 mins to draw, 2s to take a shot, attach and send it via Whatsapp to my wife.She loves it. Perfect!

If you view this page's source, or get your mouse over the piece, you might already knew that I named it "This Is Us". Normally I don't name my quick sketch, just give it some fun description, but this piece is special. This is us. The husband, the wife, the son, one dog, three cats. This is my family at home. This is the vision which cross my mind everytimes I am driving my bike back to home after work.

It costed me 5 mins for each piece like this one, but it costed me almost a decade to build the family in this piece. That's why pieces like this one are always special to me. That's why I always name every piece like this. That's why I always feel thankful because I could draw and I could build a family like this.

And maybe that's why I like to draw.
