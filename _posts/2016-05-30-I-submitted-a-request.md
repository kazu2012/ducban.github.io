Last year I backed an awesome campaign on [IndieGogo](https://www.indiegogo.com). The campaign owners said that they will made chargers with have convenient features like magnetic adapters or super fast charging speed. The campaign owners got **$335,339 USD** total funds raised. And then they [went away](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/zaptip-the-world-s-first-magnetic-super-charger/x/11134306#/comments).

Today I decide to submit a request to IndieGogo. Here it is:

	Hello there,

	I think I am not the only want who contact with you to ask for a support about Zaptip: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/zaptip-the-world-s-first-magnetic-super-charger/x/11134306#/

	As you should already knew, there was no product delivered on Oct, 2015. The campaign owner stopped update two months ago. We backers were very patient but we were tired of reading the campaign owners lies so we did request for refunding. If you care about us you will easily find the requests on the campaign comment page.

	How come a scammer created a campaign page on your website, took the money and then walked away without any respect to your customer like this case?

	I am not sure if you response to this email or not but I still want to see it out as a ping.

	Do you allow scammer on IndieGogo?

	Bests,
	Ban Nguyen.

To be honest I don't believe that IndieGogo will do anything because if they care about their customers they should have done it before. IndieGogo might not give a shit about my request. They better do it. Worser, they would give me some inquiries about my case, before some explanations about the reason why they couldn't do anything for helping me based on their terms and policies. It took us, the customers, a while for realising that we were scammed and this duration was also our chance to claim our refund. Now, the time is up - the game is over. That's it. The scammers won. IndieGogo might also their teammates.

But I still think what's if I am wrong? Therefore I submit the request. Now we wait.
