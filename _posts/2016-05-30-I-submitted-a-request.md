Last year I backed an awesome campaign on [IndieGogo](https://www.indiegogo.com). The campaign owners said that they will made chargers with have convenient features like magnetic adapters or super fast charging speed. The campaign owners got **$335,339 USD** total funds raised. And then they [went away](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/zaptip-the-world-s-first-magnetic-super-charger/x/11134306#/comments).

Today I decide to submit a request to IndieGogo. Here it is:

	Hello there,

	I think I am not the only one who contact with you to ask for a support about Zaptip: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/zaptip-the-world-s-first-magnetic-super-charger/x/11134306#/

	As you should already knew, there was no product delivered on Oct, 2015. The campaign owner stopped update two months ago. We backers were very patient but we were tired of reading the campaign owners lies so we did request for refunding. If you care about us you will easily find the requests on the campaign comment page.

	How come a scammer created a campaign page on your website, took the money and then walked away without any respect to your customer like this case?

	I am not sure if you response to this email or not but I still want to see it out as a ping.

	Do you allow scammer on IndieGogo?

	Bests,
	Ban Nguyen.

To be honest I don't believe that IndieGogo will do anything because if they care about their customers they should have done it before. IndieGogo might not give a shit about my request. They better do it. Worser, they would give me some inquiries about my case, before some explanations about the reason why they couldn't do anything for helping me based on their terms and policies. It took us, the customers, a while for realising that we were scammed and this duration was also our chance to claim our refund. Now, the time is up - the game is over. That's it. The scammers won. IndieGogo might also their teammates.

But I still think what’s if I am wrong? Therefore I submitted the request. Now we wait.

*Update 1:* Two days after submitted the request, I receive the answer from a guy named Will.

	Hi Ban,

To conclude, Will suggested that I open the Campaign page to report it as “prohibited content” which I believe that people already did. He also provided two links  which point out that the platform of IndieGogo is open so if you got scammed you will need to take it back by yourself. Yay, he did it very good.

But the point is people got scammed on IndieGogo. That means they have to do something better than protecting themselves by this “I told you so” statement, right? So, I replied to this email.

	Hi Will,

	Your information is not helping and none of the provided references are relevant to my ticket which contains the particular Campaign page’s url and a Call-to-Action request.

	I don’t believe that you want to help me out of the situation and take back my money. Saying your system having this having that which is truth worthy doesn’t work. If it works, why should I contact you in this awkward conversion? The reason why I contact with you is some scammers were using your system to scam us. In this case I think there are two actions you should do:

	1/ Skip the bullshit. Open the provided url of the Campaign page and then read the Comment section. After that confirm that we were scammed ON YOUR SYSTEM.

	2/ Do anything you could do to resolve the issue. Even if you couldn’t do anything, say SORRY for letting it happened would be better than explaining the bullshit to us.

	Btw, base on your action which didn’t go straight to the point, I would like to thank you for confirming that your service allows scammers to take money from us.

	Best Regards,
	Ban Nguyen.

Now we wait.
