One of my friends, a designer, told me that an employer asked him the question below in an interview. Bam!!!, right in the face, the BIG question.

> What is the design trend of this year and the next year?

Of course I could answer this question easily. I could fancy to talk about the trend because I read about it all day everyday. But to be honest I don't think this is the right question to ask if you need to hire someone. In the curcumtance that you are in Vietnam, asking this kind of question matters nothing.

Did you see the film [The Intern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intern_(2015_film))? If you didn't then you should. In the early scene of the film there was an interview between a young man and an old man. Well, the young man was the employer and here was his question for his seventy-year-old employee?

> Where you see yourself in ten years?

Again, Bam!!!, right in the face, the BIG question.

The problem of a big question is its answer may would to be big. The conversation after this answer would have to be big, too. So instead of getting to know each other, sharing experiences and discussing directly about some real world issues... you might found yourself in the middle of a bundle of big things which already made the interview lose its track.

I was an employer who was looking for someone to work with me. I also did survive many interviews when I was looking for a job. To me an interview is the chance to meet, to share and to discuss. No matter you are an employer or an employee, __meeting a new person__, __sharing some knowledges__, __discussing on how to get shit done__ will always __gain you positive experiences__. Of course nothing could be wrong if you want to enquiry your next designer about how they aware about the trend. I just prefer something more ordinary.

About something ordinary, I did plan to write my Interview 101 but then I found these [good vibes from James Padolsey](http://james.padolsey.com/p/good-interview-vibes/ "Good Interview Vibes"). They are all good advices. If you are an employee then this list is useful to you too. How about "__Don't be afraid to ask tough questions__".

Good luck with that.
