No, you are not seeing it wrong. There is an emoji at the end of the url of the first bullet on the list below. _Spoiler alert!_ This article is an amazingly good read about webdesigners and their medium to create their works.

* [Web designers, can you speak web?](https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/speak-web/#ðŸŽ¹)
* Have you ever asked yourself this question: [What does Unsplash cost?](http://backstage.crew.co/what-does-unsplash-cost/). No matter your answer is "Yes" or "No", you should read this article. _Spoiler alert again!_ There are three reactions after the cost was revealed. **Which reaction are you?** Please read the article, then answer this question. I will wait for you at the end of this list.
* [Founder Mantras](http://foundermantras.com/) is the showcase of wise words from successful founders. A source of inspiration. Plus, don't drop your jaw, they also provide a new tab plugin for Chrome.
* [Use Your Interface](http://uyi.io/) is yet another showcase of great UI. I like this website a lot that's why it made it to be listed here.
* [Buttons in Design Systems](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/buttons-in-design-systems-eac3acf7e23#.5bqv6vii1) is an article about putting buttons into your design. Cost you 8-10 mins to read. Save you tons of time later.

Let's get back to the question of **Which reaction are you?** from the second bullet on the list above. If your reaction is one of the listed reactions from the article, then nothing to say here. You are amazing then keep up your work. But if none of these reactions is your reaction after read the cost then we should meet. I am serious, I will buy you a cup of Saigon Saison beer at [á»¤t á»¤t QuÃ¡n](http://www.quanutut.com/menu/) how about it?
