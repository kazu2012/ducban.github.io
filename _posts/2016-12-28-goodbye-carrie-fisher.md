It's not easy to start new days with some bad news. Two days ago it was about [Geogre Micheal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Michael) and today it is all about [Carrie Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Fisher). Maybe we are reaching the day that people of our generation are set to be gone.

Frankly, I wasn't a fan of [Princess Leia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Leia) (and her brother [Luke Skywalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker)). They were way too cheesy to me in the film series. I knew someone would be angry with me because to them these two roles were classic. My defend, I am a fan of [Han Solo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Solo), [Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi), [Master Yoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda), these roles were classic too. The only thing I like about Princess Leia is her choice to hope while people tend to seek for some chances to win. Also, the Princess' hair was always cute.

RIP our Princess, thanks for spreading hope over the galaxy. May the Force be with you. :)
