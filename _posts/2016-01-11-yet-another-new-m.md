Don't worry. Mallory is still alive. Also, the new M won't replace him as James Bond's line manager. It might be James' next assistant. A personal assistant which is built-in inside [Facebook Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/).

Yeah, you heard me right, M isn't from MI6 but Facebook.

And, not like Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, M is genderless. I don't really know what it means but it's clearly no change that [Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raj_Koothrappali) will fall in love with M. Also, Facebook said M isn't 100% AI but a hybrid of human help and computer algorithms. Again, I don't know what it means but, once again, I'm very sure that M won't send any terminator back to 1984. Its human half will avoid it.

So, to sum-up. Facebook has a pretty domain name for its messenger app: __messenger.com__. This messenger app will allow people to buy thing inside of its chat windows thank a lot to __M__. And M has __no gender__.

Btw, [IP Man 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_Man_3) is good, let see it.
