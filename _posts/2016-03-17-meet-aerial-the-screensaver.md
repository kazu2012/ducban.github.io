Aerial was originally created for Apple TV, an awesome developer thought it should be on OS X also. And then "Bam", [here it is](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial "Apple TV Aerial Screensaver for Mac").

There are three things I love about Aerial:

* Its screensavers are __loaded directly__ from Apple, so we're __never out of date__.
* It _plays different screensaver on each display__. Way too cool, right?.
* Its creator is kind of the hacker who nothing could stop. He wrote Aerial in Swift, released it open source and support different kinds of deployment. You could install it manually or using Terminal via [Brew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/ "Brew Cask"). As for now, Jon the Creator is still working on __making Aerial to support offline mode__. I think he will never stop making his products better.

This Aerial is the reason why I didn't fancy to follow big persons but developers on Github and artists on Instagram. Big persons would teach me both big words and very pratical success stories. I knew that and appreciated that. The problem is they are big. While I'm not always ready to learn something big, some lines of code or some pieces of art might easier to swallow.

Am I the only one?
