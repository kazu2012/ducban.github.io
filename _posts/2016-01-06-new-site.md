Firstly, this new website has a page named "[About B3](/about-b3/)". If you read it, I mean if you already read it then you might recoignised that the old stuffs already went to nowhere without any explanation. __The Owner__ did write something about "Why?" but even if you already read it I still doubt that you are having any clue. So let me do a sum-up for you: __The Owner__ wanted to change. A new him, a new website how about it?

## Really, "Blah blah blah"?
This node should be a "Hello World" post, but please, __The Owner__ thought it was too clique to be a "Hello World" post that's why this cool guy decided not to do it. He thought "How about __"Blah blah blah"__?" without thinking it twice that "Blah blah blah" is a new "Hello World" which might clique, too.

# More posts will come.
Well, _normally_ when someone got something done, they might spending time messing around this stuff for a while until they have a newer thing to work with. That's why we could believe that more meaningful posts would come. Question: Is B3 that _normal_ we mentioned?

Anyway, thanks for going there, reading this "Blah blah blah" post. Now you can close this tab. See you in the future.

With love,
__B3__.
