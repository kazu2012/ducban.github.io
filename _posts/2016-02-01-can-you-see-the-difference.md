__The Wife__ dyed her hair, it was lovely. But then the question came. One of the scariest questions which no husband want to be asked.

The question is: "Can you see the difference?".

Suddenly __The Husband__ wish that he could commit the latest version of his wife into Git. If he could do it, he can now easily tell her about how differenct she is based on the diff of the repository.

He didn't see the change of her color. He told her that. She gave him a deathly silent minute. Dang you Git, when will you support committing people?

But then he asked a girl if she could see any change of her new hair. The girl said she could. "Her hair is now brown with some blue line spark underneath!" - said the girl.

So Git, once you could simulate the girl's eyes, you could save all the husbands in the world. And someday __The Husband__ would start a note with "__The Wife__ had a new haircut, it was amazing." That's all, no question comes along.

And the world would in peace for a while. Yes, before other questions come.
