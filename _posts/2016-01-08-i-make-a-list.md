It happened a lot when I wanted to write something but then I lost the spark. The dots couldn't be connected. I deteled some lines and then decided to delete all. It was hurt since it wasn't easy for me to write all them down with my writing skill. To ease the pain, I make a list.
<!--more-->

Normally the list is all about web development stuffs, like below:

* [Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/) shared his thought about [Video Background](https://css-tricks.com/should-i-use-a-video-as-a-background/). Two questions got answered: It's been 3 years since the techniche set a trend, does it still hot to use it for the next website? If yes then which is the best practice?
* It is 2016. [Update Your Footer.](http://updateyourfooter.com/)

Sometimes the list contains some useful stuffs which I don't want to share such as:

* [Visual Planning for Designers](http://blog.invisionapp.com/visual-planning-for-designers/)
* A very inspirational Instagram of [KhÃª](https://www.instagram.com/lamkhe/)

Or, some news which you already knew:

* YNAB announced about [the new YNAB](http://www.youneedabudget.com/blog/post/the-new-ynab-is-here). Bad news: They started calling the old YNAB __"Classic YNAB"__ and will drop support for it at the end of this year. Good news: You will be charged $5/month for the new YNAB. This is great, right? Especially with the users who paid and thought that they would have a lifetime support for __"Classic YNAB"__.

And, last but not least, articles from [Medium](http://www.medium.com/), yay!

* [Stop #DailyUi Start #FixUi](https://medium.com/swlh/stop-dailyui-start-fixui-e685acc6858f#.z2z90qf7p)
* [5 learnings every Product Designer should absolutely steal from Studio Ghibli movies](https://medium.com/white-space/5-learnings-every-product-designer-should-absolutely-steal-from-studio-ghibli-movies-6c3971fffa0#.r2jve8v7p)

That's it.
