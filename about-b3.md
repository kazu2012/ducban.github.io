## Why English?
Well, this website started with __Vietnamese__, then switched to __English__, then switched back to __Vietnamese__ again. This __Vietnamese__ version lasted for a while. Nobody counts. Not that anyone cares. Haha. And, now it switched to __English__ once again. What could __The Owner__ say: "It's my website, I have the right to do it.  That's all!".

## Where are your all posts?
They are all __out of date__. Let them go.

## Why Jekyll?
This was [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) serving this website all those years. Now [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is its successor. It's all because __The Owner__ decided to change his __writing platform__. As for now when he wants to write he will open his favorite IDE [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) 3 to write down this wise words into a text file which will be saved as a markdown file. And then, he pushs this new markdown file as a new Jekyll's node to [Github](http://github.com), and __BAM!!!__, a new blog post appears on this website. Way too cool, right?

That's it. <code>free -t -m</code> no more.

## What theme is it?
This website is themed by <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon" target="_blank" title="Lanyon">Lanyon</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo" target="_blank" title="Mark Otto">@mdo</a>. It's free, Otto rocks.
