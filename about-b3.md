### About B3?
Believe him when he said he was tired to write beautiful words about himself. Belive him when he said that some idiot said that "to know about a man, read his writing, not his history in brief". Believe him when he said that it's not about him but about the universe that he always feels sorry to share with you. Believe him when he said _there is not about B3 section_ but you can still get to know him if you spend time for this website. Yeah, believe that man because if you don't, you will find that life is better than sitting in the dark reading these rants from a guy who you will never know.

### Why English?
Well, this website started with __Vietnamese__, then switched to __English__, then switched back to __Vietnamese__ again. This __Vietnamese__ version lasted for a while. Haha. But now it switched to __English__ once again. What could __The Owner__ say: "It's my website, I have the right to do it.  Yay me!".

### Where are your all posts?
They are all __out of date__. Let them go.

### Why Jekyll?
This was [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) serving this website all those years. Now [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is its successor. It's all because __The Owner__ decided to change his __writing platform__. As for now when he wants to write he will open his favorite IDE [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) 3 to write down this wise words into a text file which will be saved as a markdown file. And then he pushs this new markdown file as a new Jekyll's node to [Github](http://github.com), and __BAM!!!__, a new blog post appears on this website. Way too cool, right?

That's it. <code>free -t -m</code> no more.

### What theme is it?
This website was previous themed by <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon" target="_blank" title="Lanyon">Lanyon</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo" target="_blank" title="Mark Otto">@mdo</a>. Lanyon is always free, Otto rocks.

Early this week, the week before 2016's Xmas, __The Owner__ found <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/" target="_blank" title="Tufte CSS">Tufte CSS</a> and he decided to make a new theme based on this incredible web articles style guide and the top-notch webfont <a class="small-caps" href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book" title="et book">et book</a>. After sixteen hours predending that he was working very hard, __B3__ did it. The new version was pushed to Github Page on Dec 23th, 2016 and for sure it will be counted as the only product __The Owner__ successfully rolled out within the year.

Thanks for reading,<br>
__B3.__
